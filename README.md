Debian Simple Packaging
=======================

This is a set of scripts (mostly in the form of examples) which can
be used to build virtual packages or packages of local configuration
files for configuration of servers.

This work was presented at CREDIL.org during a lunch and learn in June,
and at the August 2012 Ottawa-Canada Linux User's Group Meeting.

The files pacakaging.{odp,pdf} contain the slides.

Better documentation is sought.

These scripts were written primary by Tyler Tidman <tyler.tidman at draak.ca>
and enhanced by Michael Richardson <mcr at credil.org>.
